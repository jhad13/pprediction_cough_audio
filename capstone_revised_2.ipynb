        "The pandemic due to Covid-19 has been affecting the world since more than 2 years. Experts agree that mass testing is essential for isolating infected individuals, and slowing the progression of the virus. There is a need for testing method which is inexpensive, can give test result within a minute, can be done without any supervision and with limited contact with other people. Here I have taken cough audio data collected from public source to segment them into equal size with cough signal and extract the audio feture mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) spectrograms using Librosa. I have used the extracted (MFCC) spectrogram to develop a deep learning Siamese network model to predict Covid-19 positive, symptomatic and healthy. This model can be use to develop a web app or cell phone app where people can upload their cough audio and know the test results for covid-positive or negative within minute. The model training accuracy was around 70% and validation accuracy calculated from confusion matrix was around 40%. Recall accuracy of 70%, 40% and 10% for Covid-19, symptomatic and Healthy classes respectively. From the recall value it can be seen that the model is predicting Covid-19 or symptomatic. "
